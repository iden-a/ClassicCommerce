* **Product Catalog:**
    * **BST-Based Catalog:** Products are organized in a Binary Search Tree for efficient search, insertion, deletion, and updates.
    * **Search Functionality:** Quickly find products by ID or name.
    * **Product Management:** Add, remove, and update product information and stock levels.
